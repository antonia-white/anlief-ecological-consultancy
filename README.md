# Anlief Ecological Consultancy

Anlief is a leading Welsh ecological consultancy with the goal of providing high quality consultancy services that safeguard British Wildlife. This website aims to inform users of when ecological services may be required, what type of ecological services may be required and why Anlief are the best consultants for the job. 

This website is targetted towards businesses and individuals that require ecological assessment for works that may go ahead - this covers a wide variety of potential clients (from large-scale vegetation management buisnesses to landowners wanting a large Oak tree removed). This site will enable potential clients to contact Anlief to organise a survey or service. This easy to use and attractive website aims to encourage clients to reach out and enquire about ecological consultancy for their projects, we aim to make the sometimes confusing and daunting process of asking for ecologcial guidance straight-forward and easily accessible.

- __Legislation - legislation.html__

  - This page is for clients who have come to the site unsure if they require ecological consulatation services or not. It will also act as a reminder to knowledgeable clients as to their legal ecological obligations when conducting a project. 
  -  This text-heavy page provides key information on the laws surrounding British wildlife and will direct users to what ecological services they require in order to avoid breaking ecological law.

      >![Legislation](documentation/testing/legislation-screenshot.png)

### Features Left to Implement 

- Carousel of quotations on the Home page overlay
  - This component would allow users to see several positive reactions to our ecology services from previous clients. This would give a user eassurance that Anlief are a professional and competent company.
  - This feature hasn't yet been implimented as Bootstrap currently does not support nested carousels, and this quotation box is nested within the hero-image. Once I have an understanding of JavaScript this feature will be easier to impliment as I am unable to automate the scroll behaviour to automatically scroll between the quotations.

- Search bar in navigation
  - This component would be particularly useful for clients who already know the ecological service they require and so will easily be able to search for that service to see if Anlief offer it. 
  - This component would additionally be useful for users to search through the website for specific laws/legislations that may be applicable to their project and ecological obligations. 
  - At this stage in development it is not fundamental, but if there was going to be additional information added about wildlife and ecology in the UK (e.g., list and description of British Protected Species, why they're protected and how to meet legal ecological obligations as to not disturb these animals) then this feature would need to be implemented. Additionally, I do not currently have the skillset in JavaScript to confidently implement this feature.
