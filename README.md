# Anlief Ecological Consultancy

Anlief is a leading Welsh ecological consultancy with the goal of providing high quality consultancy services that safeguard British Wildlife. This website aims to inform users of when ecological services may be required, what type of ecological services may be required and why Anlief are the best consultants for the job. 

This website is targetted towards businesses and individuals that require ecological assessment for works that may go ahead - this covers a wide variety of potential clients (from large-scale vegetation management buisnesses to landowners wanting a large Oak tree removed). This site will enable potential clients to contact Anlief to organise a survey or service. This easy to use and attractive website aims to encourage clients to reach out and enquire about ecological consultancy for their projects, we aim to make the sometimes confusing and daunting process of asking for ecologcial guidance straight-forward and easily accessible.

### Features Left to Implement 

- Search bar in navigation
  - This component would be particularly useful for clients who already know the ecological service they require and so will easily be able to search for that service to see if Anlief offer it. 
  - This component would additionally be useful for users to search through the website for specific laws/legislations that may be applicable to their project and ecological obligations. 
  - At this stage in development it is not fundamental, but if there was going to be additional information added about wildlife and ecology in the UK (e.g., list and description of British Protected Species, why they're protected and how to meet legal ecological obligations as to not disturb these animals) then this feature would need to be implemented. Additionally, I do not currently have the skillset in JavaScript to confidently implement this feature.

## Testing 

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fvalidator.w3.org%2Fnu%2F%3Fdoc%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcode-institute-org.github.io%252Flove-running-2.0%252Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en#css)

### Unfixed Bugs 

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.
